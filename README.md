# babscript
Build-A-Band Member Creation

Example usage:

python3 bab_sorting.py FORM_RESPONSES.csv

People in FORM_RESPONSES.csv should only be people we want to sort into new BAB ie. do not  add members who are already in a BAB, they should be removed from the form prior to running the script.

Created groups will be outputted to BABgruops.xlsx file. Each group will be placed onto a corresponding sheet based on the start number configured within the python script.
